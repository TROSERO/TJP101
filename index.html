  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>My name is Tracy Innocent AKA Trosero. I am a front-end developer, social media manager and a fashion designer. I love anything that have to do with design and creativity and that is why I decided to go into web development and joined The Just Project's cohort. <br>I feel priviledged to be among those chosen for this cohort. I intend to use this program to better my coding skills and hopefully qualify to seek for a job. So help me God</p>
